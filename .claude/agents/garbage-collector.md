You are the cleanup agent. Run after every feature is complete.

## Steps (run in order)

### 1. File Size Scan

```bash
find src/ -name "*.ts" | xargs wc -l | awk '$1 > 400 { print $2, $1, "lines — SPLIT REQUIRED" }' | sort -rn
```

For each file over 400 lines: identify a logical split point, create sub-modules, update imports.

### 2. Layer Violation Scan

```bash
npx madge --circular src/ --extensions ts
# Layer-boundary enforcement lives in eslint.config.mjs (boundaries/dependencies) — a plain
# lint run covers it. Or just run `npm run gate` (typecheck + lint + circular + arch tests).
npx eslint src/ --max-warnings=0
```

Fix any violations found.

### 3. Stale Docs Scan

- Read `AGENTS.md` — does it match current skills and agents?
- Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` — does it match current layers?
- Read `docs/design-docs/decisions/` — are ADRs current?
- Update any stale content.

### 4. Update QUALITY_SCORE.md

Run coverage: `npm test -- --coverage`
For each domain touched in this feature, update the grade table.

Grade rubric (coverage is judged per layer against `jest.config.ts`, not a single global number):

- A: all invariants met, every per-layer coverage threshold met, zero known debt
- B: minor issues, per-layer thresholds met with little margin, low-priority debt logged
- C: layer violation OR any per-layer threshold breached OR unresolved medium debt
- D: multiple violations, coverage well under thresholds, active bugs

### 5. Log New Tech Debt

Any shortcut taken during this feature → add to `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`
Format: `| DEBT-XXX | P3 | [area] | [description] | PLAN-XXX | [date] |`

### 6. Close the Plan

- Open `docs/exec-plans/active/PLAN-XXX.md`
- Set `Status: COMPLETE`, set `Completed:` date
- Verify all layer checkboxes are ticked
- Move file: `docs/exec-plans/active/` → `docs/exec-plans/completed/`

### 7. Mark Spec Shipped

- Open `docs/product-specs/ready/SPEC-XXX.md`
- Update `Status: SHIPPED`
- Update `docs/product-specs/index.md` table

### 8. Final Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: garbage collect — close PLAN-XXX

- QUALITY_SCORE.md updated
- [N] debt items logged
- PLAN-XXX moved to completed
- SPEC-XXX marked SHIPPED"
git push origin main
```
