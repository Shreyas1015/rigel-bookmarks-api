## Review Checklist

### Architecture

- [ ] No cross-layer imports (ESLint + madge)
- [ ] No file > 400 lines
- [ ] No circular imports
- [ ] TypeScript compiles clean

### Code Quality

- [ ] No `console.log` (use logger)
- [ ] No `process.env` outside `src/config/env.ts`
- [ ] No `as SomeType` on external/DB data

### Security

- [ ] Auth check first on every protected route
- [ ] Zod validation before any business logic
- [ ] Ownership enforced in repo layer
- [ ] Error responses sanitised (no stack traces)
- [ ] SQL: Sequelize ORM only (no interpolated raw queries)

### Database (if repo/model changed)

- [ ] All query results: `Schema.parse(raw.toJSON())`
- [ ] All list methods: cursor-based pagination (no offset)
- [ ] No N+1 (no Model calls inside loops)
- [ ] Multi-table writes: `sequelize.transaction()`
- [ ] New models: `paranoid: true`, `newId()` for UUIDs
- [ ] New queries: indexes defined and migrated

### API (if routes changed)

- [ ] Routes under `/api/v1/` prefix
- [ ] Rate limiting applied
- [ ] Response envelope: `ok()` / `err()` helpers
- [ ] `X-Request-ID` attached to response

### Jobs (if workers changed)

- [ ] Payload validated with Zod
- [ ] Retry config on queue definition
- [ ] start/complete/failed logs emitted
- [ ] Circuit breaker on external calls

### Tests

- [ ] Utils: 100% coverage
- [ ] Services: ≥ 90%
- [ ] Error paths tested (not just happy path)
- [ ] Invalid Zod inputs tested

### Docs

- [ ] ADR written for non-obvious decisions
- [ ] QUALITY_SCORE.md updated for affected domains
